Title: "Forbidden Harmony"

Abstract:
"Forbidden Harmony" is an immersive visual novel game set in a mystical realm where angels and demons coexist, each with distinct powers and responsibilities. In this world, a longstanding rule prohibits angels from engaging in physical contact or romantic relationships with demons. The story unfolds as players navigate the challenges faced by the protagonists, exploring themes of love, acceptance, and breaking societal norms.

Lore:
In the ethereal realm of Elysium, angels are bestowed with the responsibility of maintaining order, harmony, and light. Conversely, demons, while often misunderstood, play a crucial role in the balance of creation. The Cosmos Council, a governing body formed by celestial beings, enforces a strict decree that forbids angels from engaging in any form of physical intimacy with demons.

The game's narrative begins in the celestial city of Seraphica, where the player assumes the role of an angelic protagonist, tasked with maintaining the delicate balance between the two realms. As tensions rise and a mysterious force threatens to disrupt the cosmic equilibrium, the protagonist discovers that breaking the taboo might be the key to saving Elysium.

Characters:

Seraphina (Angel Protagonist): A compassionate and curious angel who questions the traditions and rules of Elysium. Seraphina possesses unique healing abilities and is determined to uncover the truth behind the forbidden rule.

Lilith (Demon Antagonist): A charismatic and rebellious demon who challenges the societal norms imposed on her kind. Lilith has the power to manipulate shadows and is intrigued by the prospect of bridging the gap between angels and demons.

Celestia (Angel Mentor): An experienced and wise angel who serves as Seraphina's mentor. Celestia adheres strictly to the traditional values but begins to question her beliefs as events unfold.

Azura (Demon Ally): A mischievous demon who aids Seraphina on her journey. Azura possesses the power of illusion and is determined to prove that demons and angels can coexist peacefully.

Gameplay:
Players will navigate through Seraphica, making decisions that impact the relationships between characters and the overall storyline. The forbidden romance element introduces a "Chaos Variable" that measures the protagonist's deviation from the established norms. As the Chaos Variable increases, players will face more challenges and unlock different story paths, ultimately determining the fate of Elysium.

"Forbidden Harmony" invites players to explore a rich narrative filled with twists, turns, and emotional depth, challenging preconceived notions and encouraging them to question the boundaries of love and acceptance in a fantastical world.
